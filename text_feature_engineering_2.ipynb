    "# Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "In the BoW approach, with all the information that you were able to pull out of the text, one thing that you didn't really use was semantics—the *meaning* of the words and sentences. The models that you built in the previous checkpoint may know that Jane Austen tends to use the word `lady` a lot in her writing, but they don't know what a lady is. There is nothing in your work on NLP so far that would allow a model to say whether `queen` or `car` is more similar to `lady`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of semantic information, models can get tripped up on things like synonyms (`milady` and `lady`). You could modify the spaCy dictionary to include `lady` as the lemma of `milady`, then use lemmas for all your analyses. But for this to be an effective approach, you would have to go through your entire corpus and identify all synonyms for all words by hand. This approach would also discard subtle differences in the connotations of words, concepts, ideas, or emotions associated with `lady` (which elicits thoughts of formal manners and England) and `milady` (which elicits thoughts of medieval ages and Renaissance Faires).\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is complicated, and trying to explicitly model all the information encoded in a language is nearly impossibly complicated. Fortunately, there are some approaches and methods that you can use to get around this to some extent. In general, these methods work on a corpus of text and learn the rules of the language by identifying recurring patterns within the corpus. As the outcome, all of these methods produce a numerical representation of the words. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this checkpoint, you will learn about the *term frequency–inverse document frequency* (TF-IDF) method as a modification of the BoW approach of the previous checkpoint. You'll also learn about *latent semantic analysis*."

    "# BoW revisited: TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "The BoW approach rests upon counting the occurrences of the words in the documents (which in this case are the sentences). However, there is other information that you can exploit from the occurrences of the words, apart from their counts in the sentences. In the following, you'll go step by step as you learn about TF-IDF vectorization, which takes some clever steps when counting the words. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. \"The best Monty Python sketch is the one about the dead parrot; I laughed so hard.\"\n",
    "2. \"I laugh when I think about Python's Ministry of Silly Walks sketch; it is funny, funny, funny, the best!\"\n",

    "As a human being, it's easy to see that the sentences involve two topics: comedy and ice cream.

Ignoring the stop words `the`, `is`, `and`, `a`, `of`, `I`, and `about`, discarding words that occur only once, and reducing words like `laughing` to their root form (`laugh`), the term-document matrix for these sentences would be as follows:\n",

If you were to use this term-document matrix as is to teach a computer to parse sentences, `best` would end up as a significant identifier for both topics. And every time that you gave the model a new sentence to identify that included `best`, it would bring up both topics. Not very useful. To avoid this, you want to weight the matrix so that words that occur in many different sentences have lower weights than words that occur in fewer sentences. It is important to put a floor on this though—words that only occur once are totally useless for finding associations between sentences. \n",

Here, you'll briefly touch upon some popular NLP applications that make use of TF-IDF vectorization. In the first one, you'll briefly review how you can measure the similarities of the documents. And in the second one, you'll explore *topic modeling*, which refers to deriving the fundamental topics of a collection of documents."

    "## Vector space model\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you've had some practice thinking of data as existing in multidimensional space. Your sentences exist in an n-dimensional space, where *n* is equal to the number of terms in your term-document matrix. The vector representation of the text is referred to as a *vector space model* (VSM). You can use this representation to compute the similarity between the sentences and a new phrase or sentence. This method is often used by search engines to match a query to possible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the similarity of sentences to a new sentence, transform the new sentence into a vector and place it in the space. You can then calculate how different the angles are for the original vectors and the new vector, and identify the vector whose angle is closest to the new vector. Typically, this is done by calculating the cosine of the angle between the vectors. If the two vectors are identical, the angle between them will be 0°, and the cosine will be 1. If the two vectors are orthogonal, with an angle of 90°, the cosine will be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were running a search query, then you would return sentences that are most similar to the query sentence, ordered from the highest similarity score (cosine) to the lowest. Pretty handy!\n",
    "\n",
    "As cool as this is, there are limitations to the VSM. Because it treats each word as distinct from every other word, it can run aground on *synonyms* (treating words that mean the same thing as though they are different, like big and large). Also, because it treats all occurrences of a word as the same regardless of context, it can run aground on *polysemy*, where there are different meanings attached to the same word (for example, \"I need a break\" versus \"I break things\"). In addition, the vector space model has difficulty with very large documents because the more words a document has, the more opportunities it has to diverge from other documents in the space. This can make it difficult to see similarities."

    "## Latent semantic analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to this problem is to reduce your TF-IDF-weighted term-document matrix into a lower-dimensional space. In other words, you can express the information in the matrix using fewer rows by combining the information from multiple terms into one new row or dimension. You can accomplish this using principal components analysis (PCA). *Latent semantic analysis* (LSA), also called *latent semantic indexing*, is the process of applying PCA to a TF-IDF matrix. What you get in the end is clusters of terms that presumably reflect a topic. Each document will get a score for each topic, with higher scores indicating that the document is relevant to the topic. Documents can pertain to more than one topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSA is handy when your corpus is too large to topically annotate by hand, or when you don't know what topics characterize your documents. It is also useful as a way of creating features to be used in other models.\n",
