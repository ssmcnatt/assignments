Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below.

1) Put prices in one list, and associated category flags in 4 other lists
2) Use a scatter plot to plot each category against the price of each item
3) Create a model to predict which category typically has the highest price.  If a certain person's purchases contain a larger number
   of the higher priced items, they will be less likely to pay their bills on time
4) Weight the higher priced category item more, the lower priced category items less
